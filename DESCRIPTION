Description: MOGAMUN is a multi-objective genetic algorithm that identifies
    active modules in a multiplex biological network. This allows analyzing
    different biological networks at the same time. MOGAMUN is based on
    NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, version II), which we
    adapted to work on networks.
